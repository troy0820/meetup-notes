We decided that the exercise would help us better understand OOP if we were able to design the classes ourselves instead of build against the interface given to us.  

Making entity object to model book data shown http://chadicus.herokuapp.com/books/bk101

Everyone submitted a pull request so we could compare entity implementations.

Next step is to create BookCollection to implement Iterator: http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.iterator.php.  We decided to work on this as a group.  We worked on this by, first creating a line in a test type file.  Then move forward in the implementation of BookCollection by resolving issues that arose in the test.

After confusions with PHP predefined methods such as current, key, etc. we decided that next meetup we will have a presentation on Iterator.
